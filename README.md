# Flicking Through Netflix Data 

A project by Mini Yadav, Isha Singh, Emmanuela Osei Owusu, Sam Stafford, James Lilley and Elena Dragomir. 

# Project Outline

Our project sets out to dive into two interesting data stats we found to do with massively influencial and popular streaming service, Netflix. We hope to uncover insights related to both the revenue and the subscriber count of the service, as well as its relation to Netflix Originals - shows which Netflix funds or licenses exclusively. 


## Questions

* Whether regions growth follows similar patterns - or if different regions behave more indepentadly.  
* Whether or not highly rated shows lead on release to an increase in subscribers. 
* How runtime affects the scores on an IMDB
* How runtime has changed over time, and whether this can be correlated to other factors.

## Breakdown of Tasks

* Cleaning datasets 
Checking for null values, parsing for outliers, consider dropping values (maybe notes on why things were and weren't dropped)

Making dataframes which compile relevant results from our questions which are easy to read and use for data visualisation.

* Create visualisations for to show our findings.
Producing 2+ visualaisations which best suit the data and give compelling insights about our data. 

## Misc

* Consider using ombd api to get further data about netflix originals, for data such as total reviews.
