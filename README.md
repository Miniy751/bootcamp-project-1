# Flicking Through Netflix Data 

A project by Mini Yadav, Isha Singh, Emmanuela Osei Owusu, Sam Stafford, James Lilley and Elena Dragomir. 

# Project Outline

Our project sets out to dive into two interesting data stats we found to do with massively influencial and popular streaming service, Netflix. We hope to uncover insights related to both the revenue and the subscriber count of the service, as well as its relation to Netflix Originals - shows which Netflix funds or licenses exclusively. 

## Questions of Focus

* Does Netflix's growth show similar trends between regions?
* Does runtime affect how well a show is received? 
* Is runtime affected by genre and how has runtime changed over time?
